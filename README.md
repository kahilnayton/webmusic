 A web based drum machine, arpeggiator and synth.

## Abstract
WebMusic is a React front-end / Express back end application to allow users to create loops and music directly in their browser.
Inspired by The Art of Noise and other noise artists such as the great Italian Futurist Luigi Russolo this application allows you to try different sounds synthesised by the Tone.js sound library. A user can play these sounds against a drum machine, which in true noice music fashion appears to have little re;ivance to the different synth sounds.
These Different sounds can be effected with the use of a parameter and then they can be saved to the users favouites list.
