A web based drum machine, arpeggiator and synth.

## Abstract
WebMusic is a React front-end / Express back end application to allow users to create loops and music directly in their browser.
Inspired by The Art of Noise and other noise artists such as the great Italian Futurist Luigi Russolo this application allows you to try different sounds synthesised by the Tone.js sound library. A user can play these sounds against a drum machine, which in true noise music fashion appears to have little relevance to the different synth sounds.
These Different sounds can be effected with the use of a parameter and then they can be saved to the users favorites list.
